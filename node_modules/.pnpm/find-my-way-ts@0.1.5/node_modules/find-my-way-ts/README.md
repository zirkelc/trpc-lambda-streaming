# find-my-way-ts

Fork of the amazing find-my-way router.

A crazy fast HTTP router, internally uses an highly performant [Radix Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree) (aka compact [Prefix Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)), supports route params, wildcards, and it's framework independent.
